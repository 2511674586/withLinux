consider a usb stick which is /dev/sdb(GPT TABLE), part (sdb1), mounted at /mnt.

0. parted.
	maketable, makepart.
	For more info lookup gnu's grub doc. if you are installing grub into a GPT disk while your motherboard is BIOS instead of EFI/UEFI, you need to :
	1.A. reserve some space (less than 1MB) at the beginning of disk.
	1.B. OR make a tiny part at the beginning, in my case 1MB is enough.
	2. parted -> help set -> turn on the 'bios_grub' flag on that partition if you have created. it's ok to pass this step. 

1. bootstrap
	> apt install bootstrap
	man bootstrap
	...
	then I packed the base system.
	mount target disk on /mnt
	extract jessie.stage3.tar.gz into /mnt
		tar -zxv -f FILE.tar.gz -C /mnt

2. install kernel and grub
	(may need
	 	mount --bind /dev /mnt/dev
		(optional)mount --bind /sys /mnt/sys
		(optional)mount --bind /proc /mnt/proc
	)
	> chroot /mnt /bin/bash
	 apt-get install linux-image-amd64
	> vim /etc/fstab (use blkid(8) to identify UUID)
	/* FIXME :
	   I only modified fstab in this case.
	   But it boots well, runs well (even gnome3)
	   I need to lookup the general install procedure of debian,
	   then complete the installation.

	install grub (BIOS-GPT case): grub-common grub2-common grub-pc etc.

	OUT of chroot
	man grub-install
	> grub-install <target_device>, [--force]
		hint : If you haven't created a 'bios_grub' partition, --force option is needed, or failure will occur. 
	
	> chroot /mnt /bin/bash
		sudo update-grub
		passwd

	> umount
	
	TEST
	then you can try it with qemu, like
	> qemu -enable-kvm -m xx -hda /dev/sdb
	to see if it works.

3. boot via this stick.
	have fun!
	hint : the random access performance and read latency of USB3.0 is much better than SATA2 HDD, so this is really interesting.
