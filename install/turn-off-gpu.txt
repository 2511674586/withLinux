 --- [ 1. acpi-call ] ---

Turn off individual video card via *acpi-call*  

frist, install those headers of kernel and other related pkgs.  
then clone acpi-call from github:  
`git clone git://github.com/mkottman/acpi_call.git`  

cd to its DIR, then make, make install.  
`depmod -a`  
`modprobe acpi-call`  
`bash ./sample/turn_off_gpu.sh`  

blacklist nouveau (NVIDIA) in /etc/modprobe.d/
see man modprobe.d

*note*  
it works with a GT525M(GF108) card. And a half electricity would be saved.

Another way is to use vgaswitchroo in debugfs (?) (I have not tested)  

 --- [ 3. bbswitch-dkms ] ---

It's better than acpi-call (in fact surpressed acpi-call),
install it with this command is enough:
  apt install bbswitch-dkms
