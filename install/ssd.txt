1. scheduler, cfq is designed for rotational disks.
	/sys/block/sda/queue/scheduler
	deadline
	or noop

2. tmpfs, reduce write into ssd.
	vim fstab
	tmpfs /tmp tmpfs rw,noatime,nosuid 0 0

3. mount
	parts that is on ssd.
	UUID=... / ext4 defaults,discard,noatime,commit=300 0 0
	where 'commit' is just optional,
		'discard' is useful.
		'noatime' reduces write activated by atime record.

4. Redirect write
	Deal with directories such as ~user/.cache
	:
	rm -r .cache
	ln -s /dev/shm .cache

hint:
	to identify SSDs,
	find /sys | grep rotational
	then
	find /sys | grep rotational | xargs cat

	if rotational = 0 then
		it is ssd
	else if rotational = 1 then
		it is not ssd, but a hard disk
	fi
