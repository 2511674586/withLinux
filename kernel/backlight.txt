Adjust backlight brightness:

`ls /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video?/`  
It is the file named "brightness"
Meanwhile, other files are good reference.

To change brightness, just
> echo BRIGHTNESS > brightness
for those pc which has 2 video cards, 
you need to choose one from acpi_video0 and acpi_video1 etc...
if it doesn't work, that infers your current display is not via this card.

hint
$ sudo echo N > file
a failure returned.

dir "acpi_video?" is a symbol link to /sys/devices/...
