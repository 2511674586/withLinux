# withlinux

(Part of) My personal linux journal for sharing, including skills, little tricks, etc.  
Some of them are amazingly useful.  
Some of them are not so useful.  
by the way this helps me to organize note files neatly.  
  
Anyway, thanks for reading, any advice will be appreciated.  
  
NOTE that  
I mainly use [Debian](http://debian.org), so there may be many contents related to it.  
The good news is, many tricks work on Ubuntu, Mint, etc.
