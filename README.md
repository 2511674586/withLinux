# withlinux

(Part of) My personal linux journal for sharing, including skills, little tricks, etc.  
Some of them are amazingly useful.  
Some of them are not so useful.  
Some of method were given in wikis.  
  
Anyway, thanks for reading, any advice will be appreciated.  
  
NOTE that  
I mainly use [Debian](https://www.debian.org), so there may be many contents related to it.  
The good news is, many tricks also work well on Ubuntu, Mint, etc.  
  
This repo was started on 2014/06/28.  
[I](https://github.com/CDLuminate) will keep updating this.  
Have fun. :-)
