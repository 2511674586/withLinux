(Part of) My personal linux journal for sharing, including skills, little tricks, etc.  
Sometimes they are amazingly useful.  
by the way this helps me to organize note files neatly.  
  
NOTE that  
I mainly use [Debian](http://debian.org), so there may be many contents related to it.  
The good news is, many tricks work on Ubuntu, Mint, etc.
