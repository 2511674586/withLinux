A.1 JAVA configure
</Index>

0. Networking setup.

1. Zookeeper
see http://http://zookeeper.apache.org/
	1.1 download zookeeper, choosing a proper release.
		here I chose [Release 3.3.6(stable)]
	1.2 set up java
		java JDK (>= java 6)
		# apt-cache search openjdk
			openjdk-6-jdk, (not jre) notice $(arch).
	1.3 setup zookeeper
		wget zookeeper.tar.gz
		tar
		cp -r zookeeper-3.3.6/ /usr/local/
		ln -s /usr/local/zookeeper-3.3.6/ /usr/local/zookeeper

		vim /etc/profile
		+ export ZOOKEEPER_HOME="/usr/local/zookeeper"
		+ export PATH=$PATH:$ZOOKEEPER/bin

		cp /usr/local/zookeeper/conf/zoo_sample.cfg /usr/local/zookeeper/conf/zoo.cfg
		/* use the default for a test, or modify it as needed. */

		mkdir /tmp/zookeeper
		/* if not, running "zkServer.sh start" will return false 'cuz [ -e /tmp/zookeeper ] == false */
		/* in fact, if 'zkServer.sh failed, it might have mkdir, so run again would be fine. */

		mkdir /var/log/zookeeper
		
		then the setup of [zookeeper] is done.

		* log issue of zookeeper (http://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.3.3/zookeeperAdmin.html#sc_maintenance)
	1.4 verifying zookeeper
		telnet/netcat
		echo ruok | nc zkServer 2181 -> are you ok?
		echo stat | nc zkServer 2181 -> stat
		echo conf | nc zkServer 2181 -> ..
		
		should see zookeeper official docs.

2. Dependency storm
see http://storm.incubator.apache.org/documentation/Setting-up-a-Storm-cluster.html
	2.1 storm 0.8.1 dependency
		2.1.1 ZeroMQ 2.2.0
			wget 
			tar 
			cd ./zeromq-2.2.0
			./confugure
			make
			make install
			done setup [zeromq]
			/* may need packages like "uuid-dev", just install them as told. */
		2.1.2 JZMQ
			java binding of ZeroMQ
			git clone jzmq
			cd
			./autogen.sh
			./configure
			make
			make install
			? I passed this.
		2.1.3 java 6
			as above.
			openjdk and sun-jdk both work well.
		2.1.4 unzip
			apt-cache search unzip
			install
		2.1.5 python 2.7
			apt-cache search python2
			install
		done.
	2.2 storm 0.9 dependency
		2.2.1 java 6
		2.2.2 python2.6.6
			python2.7 works too.
3. setup storm and confugure
	first, you may need to add a user (like storm) and add it to a group (like storm).
	3.1 setup
		wget storm
		unzip
		mv storm-0.8.1/ /usr/local/storm
		ln -s /usr/local/storm-0.8.1/ /usr/local/storm
		/* make symlink so that it is convenient to manage different versions */

		vim /etc/profile
		+ export STORM_HOME="/usr/local/storm"
		+ export PATH=$PATH:$STORM_HOME/bin
	3.2 configure
		vim ?/storm/conf/storm.yaml
		+ storm.zookeeper.servers:
		+   - "127.0.0.1"
		+ storm.zookeeper.port:
		+   2181
		+ nimbus.host:
		+   "127.0.0.1"
		+ storm.local.dir:
		+   "/tmp/storm"
		+ supervisor.slots.ports:
		+   - 6700
		+   - 6701
		+   - 6702
		+   - 6703
		p.s. "storm.local.dir" is the working directory.
	3.3 hint
		analyzer of storm.yaml is tricky.
		keep an eye on storm's log and screen printing.
		first time i run storm, it said many " at XXX " and storm just corrupted. 
		looking up ?/storm/logs/nimbus.log, search pattern "ERROR", it seems like some sort of syntax error of yaml.
		re-write the storm.yaml with nice format, it breath again.


4. Launch storm
	4.1 start zookeeper
		# /usr/local/zookeeper/bin/zkServer.sh start
	4.2 start storm
		# storm nimbus --> start the master node.
		# storm supervisor --> start the slave node.
		# storm ui --> start monitoring.
			/* storm ui should launch at the nimbus machine */
		to test the 'storm ui'
			iceweasel nimbus-addr:8080

	4.3 misc
		storm 0.8.1 + openjdk-6  [ok]
		storm 0.8.1 + jdk1.7.0_55 [ok]
		storm 0.9.0.1 + openjdk-6 [ok]

STORM local done.

Appendix A. JAVA issue
	On debian platform the packege openjdk-6-jdk seems has not done all.
	vim /etc/profile
	+ export JAVA_HOME="/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk-i386"
	or something like sun-jdk
	+ export JAVA_HOME="/usr/local/jdk1.7.0_55"
	hint:
		if you can't sure where the java_home is,
		locate jdk
		OR dpkg -L openjdk-6-jdk
		etc.
Appendix B. debug hint
	1. # storm nimbus
		then prints lots of "at xxx "
		--> 
		check storm.yaml
	2. iceweasel nimbus:8080
		"internal server error"
		-->
		check if zkServer started.
		check if storm nimbus started.

Appendix C. additional info
	1.nimbus
		the master node of cluster, like Hadoop::JobTracker.
	2.supervisor
		the worker node. like hadoop::TaskTraker.
	3.storm relies on zookeeper cluster.
		coordination.
