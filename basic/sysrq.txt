see kernel document :: sysrq

Look at this key combination:

	Ctrl + Alt + PrntScr(SysRq) + { [A-Z] }

E : Send SIGTERM to process {ALL}\{init}
I : Send SIGKILL to process {ALL}\{init}
S : Emergency sync all mounted file systems
U : Remount all mounted, read-only
B : Immediately reboot

if it doesn't work, check the bit switch :
	sudo sysctl -a | grep 'kernel.sysrq'
tweak it to 1 to enable all sysrq functions.
