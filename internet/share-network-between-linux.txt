Background:
	there are 2 linux machines, 
	one with wlan0 and eth0, witch serves as server;
	another with eth0, witch serves as client.

HINT:
	be care of NetworkManager, witch may change network settings automatically (deletes matter set by hand).

Topology:
[home gateway :: access point]
	|
	v
	[server :: wlan0]
	  |
	  [server :: forward]
	    |
	    [server :: eth0]
	    	|
		v
		[client :: eth0]

HOWTO share the net of server::wlan0 with the client with client::eth0 ?
(ipv4 solution)
* make server and client in the same subnet
	e.g.
		server# ip addr add 10.0.0.1/8 brd + dev eth0
		client# ip addr add 10.0.0.2/8 brd + dev eth0
* turn on the ip_forward of server
	e.g.
		server# echo "1" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
	OR
		server# sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
* set NAT gateway using iptables
	e.g.
		server# iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o wlan0 -j MASQUERADE
		P.S. put a outside-network-accesible interface on the place of 'wlan0'.
* set client route table
	e.g.
		client# ip route add to 0/0 via 10.0.0.1 (dev eth0)
* test and find out issue
	e.g. 
		client# traceroute -n 8.8.4.4
