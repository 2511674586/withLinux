1. Setup a basic system via bootstrap
	Debootstrap, see man
	$ debootstrap jessie /home/lumin/jessie http://127.0.0.1/debian
	(wait it until all things were set up)
	$ cd /home/lumin/jessie
	$ tar -zcv -f ../jessie.stage3.tar.gz .

2. Load / import it into docker
	//$ sudo docker load -i jessie.tar
	// docker load would fail, why ?
	$ cat jessie.stage3.tar | sudo docker import - jessie
	then it was succeed and ready to work.
