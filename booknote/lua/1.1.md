## interactive mode
`$ lua -i SCRIPT.lua` will lead you into the interpreter environment after running the script,
instead of just quitting.

## load library
`dofile("lib1.lua")`

## picking names
Similar to `C`, but keep in mind that avoid using names such as `_VERSION`,
which are Lua's preference for special symbols.

Following are reserved keywords:
```
and break do else elseif end false for function if in local nil
not or repeat return then true until while
```

Lua is case-sensitive.

## comments
line comments, similar to VHDL, are headed with `--`

chunk comments, are headed with `--[[` and ended with `--]]`

e.g.
```
-- this won't work
--[[
	print (10)
	--]]

-- but this works
---[[
	print (10)
	--]]
```

## Global variables
```
print (b) --> nil
b = 10
print (b) --> 10
```
Global variables have non-nil values.

## Dtand-Slone interpreter
```
#!/usr/bin/lua5.1
```

## Command line expression
```
lua -e "print (math.sin(12))"
```

## PS1
```
_PROMPT = " Lua5.1 > "
```

## print value in interactive mode
```
math.sin(123)   --> nothing happens
= math.sin(123) --> print
```

## the arg table
```
$ lua -e "sin=math.sin" scriptA scriptB scriptC

arg[-3] = "lua"
arg[-2] = "-e"
arg[-1] = "sin=math.sin"
arg[ 0] = "scriptA"
arg[ 1] = "scriptB"
arg[ 2] = "scriptC"
```
