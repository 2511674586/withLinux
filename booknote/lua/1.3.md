## arithmetic operators
```
-- two operands

+
-
*
/
^ (exponential)
% (a%b = a - floor(a/b)*b)

-- one operand

-
```

for float point numbers, the operator `%`
```
x = math.pi        --> 3.1415926535898
print (x - x%0.01) --> 3.14
```

## relational operators

```
< > <= >= == ~=
```

It is necessary to point out that for table, userdata and function,
the relational opeators conduct comparasion by reference instead of value.

## boolean operators
3 operators : `and or not`

shortcut evaluation
```
= 4 and 5 --> 5
= 5 and 4 --> 4
= nil and 13 --> nil
= false and 13 --> false
= 4 or 5  --> 4
= false or 5 --> 5
```

convention 1:
```
x = x or v --> if not x then x = v end
```

convention 2:
(a and b) or c --> a ? b : c

## concat strings
operator `..` will concatenate two strings, and will convert number into string if it exists in operands.

## operator priority
```
high
---
^
not  #  -(1-operand)
* / %
+ -
..
< > <= >= ~= ==
and
or
---
low
```

## table constructor
```
days = { "Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun" }
```
and `days[1] == "Mon"`

```
a = { x=10, y=20 }

--> a.x == 10
--> a.y == 20
```

Chain list
```
list = nil
for line in io.lines() do
	list = { next = list, value = line }
end

local l = list
while l do
	print (l.value)
	l = l.next
end
```

complex table
```
polyline = { color = "blue", thickness = 2,
	{ x = 0, y = 0 },
	{ x = 1, y = 1 }
}

--> polyline[1].x == 0
```

basic constructor
```
opnames = { ["+"] = "add", ["-"] = "sub" }

i.e.

{ x=0, y=0 } --> { ["x"] = 0, ["y"] = 0 }
{ "r", "g", "b" } --> { [1] = "r", [2] = "g", [3] = "b" }
```

It is noted that, most of the built-in functions assumes that your table index begins from 1,
although beginning from 0 is possible.
