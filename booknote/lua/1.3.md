## arithmetic operators
```
-- two operands

+
-
*
/
^ (exponential)
% (a%b = a - floor(a/b)*b)

-- one operand

-
```

for float point numbers, the operator `%`
```
x = math.pi        --> 3.1415926535898
print (x - x%0.01) --> 3.14
```

## relational operators

```
< > <= >= == ~=
```

It is necessary to point out that for table, userdata and function,
the relational opeators conduct comparasion by reference instead of value.
