## memory management in lua

Generally lua's memory management mechanism is enough for applications.
However some applications may want to do some customization.

In fundamental layer, lua's allocation functions can be called, while
in a relatively abstracted layer, lua's garbage collector arguments or
even garbage collector itself can be controlled.
